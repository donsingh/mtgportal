# Magic the Gathering: PORTAL

A practice project to implement a Card search and TCG E-commerce app. Mainly doing this to brush up on my Laravel and VueJS code.

## Points of Interest

[Commands](https://github.com/donsingh/mtgportal/tree/master/app/Console/Commands) -
Set of commands to pull data from [https://magicthegathering.io/](https://magicthegathering.io/) and seed the database

[DTO](https://github.com/donsingh/mtgportal/tree/master/app/DTO) -
use of `Laravel-Data` to ingest and manage external data easily

[Home.vue](https://github.com/donsingh/mtgportal/blob/master/resources/js/Pages/Home.vue) -
Homepage vue component to display cards and dynamically load mana symbols from png.

## TODO

- Paginate homepage
- Set Page
- Add Prices (?)
- Card Management Module
- Add to Cart and Checkout
- User management
- PHPUnit tests
